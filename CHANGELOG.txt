1.2.4
---
* Bugfix in fixed aperture extraction method

1.2.3
---
* Inspection mode added: using `ssos -i|--inspect path/to/analysis`, SSO candidates can quickly be visually inspected and quickly classified into SSO / Unknown / Artifact using the arrow keys
* FOV_DIMENSIONS can now be set automatically by pipeline
* The DATE-OBS keyword can now be passed in either ISOT or MJD format
* edited the GREETING to point to correct documentation
* no longer creating target directory if the images cannot be found
* Fixed a bug in the SWarp cutout creation where it would chose the wrong image extension if SCI_EXTENSION is 0
* Fixed the cutout images filename scheme so that they are now correctly ordered by epoch when calling from the command line
* Revisited the SkyBoT query: It is now executed at the beginning of the pipeline and states the amount of all known SSOs in the image. A brief overview is printed to the console.

1.2.2
---
* default.ssos is now properly included in the pip install

1.2.1
---
* SCAMP does not properly compute the proper motion of sources without a reference source association when choosing INCLUDE_ASTREFCAT to false. It is now always set to true while the bug is being investigated
* SExtractor catalogue header files are not adjusted anymore when SCAMP has not been run since the last time they were changed
* Excluded the HYGCAT from the package, it can be retrieved from http://www.astronexus.com/hyg

1.2.0
---
* Included the option to remove source detections within 1" of the reference catalogue sources in SCAMP before the pattern matching. This is turned on using the REMOVE_REF_SOURCES parameter. Random associations of SSOs with stars and galaxies are effectively removed this way. Note that the importance of the choice of reference catalogue increases.
* The pre-configured SExtractor and SCAMP config files were updated to the latest versions (2.25.0 and 2.7.7 respectively)
* Renamed several output parameters to better match common standards
* Code restructured, leading to major speed ups in SExtractor catalogue look-ups


1.1.10
---
* The SCAMP reference catalogue can now be used in the FILTER_STAR_REGIONS step, with an optional limit on the magnitude of the reference sources. Consequently, the FILTER_STAR_REGIONS step is renamed to FILTER_BRIGHT_SOURCES
* SSOs can exhibit constant apparent motion in declination. This scenario is now accounted for in the linear motion routine by transforming the equatorial to ecliptic coordinates and repeating the weighted linear fits in ecliptic longitude and latitude space
* Changed linear filter routine from scipy.optimize.curve_fit to statsmodels.api.WLS
* Changed the proper motion limits from exclusive to inclusive
* pipeline_settings.ssos is now default.ssos, analogous to astrOmatic software approach
